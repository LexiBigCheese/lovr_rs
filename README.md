# THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS

This is my attempt to make a somewhat ergonomic way to use LÃ–VR from within a rust mlua module.

There's a fair few things i could do with being generated from the docs, mainly all the enums.

For the time being, this repository is acting as a "Hey, this is what I'm working on".
